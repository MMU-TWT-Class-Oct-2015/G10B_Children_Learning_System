**Introduction**
<p>This system is created to help children to gain some basic knowledge by using interactive computer application. The target users are mainly children of ages between 4 to 10 years.  The application includes interactive exercise to learn and assess some basic knowledge about numbers, simple mathematical operations, and matching objects with their names. This system works based on suitable material for children to learn with help of using pictures, sounds, and text.</p>

**Objectives**
<p>The objectives of this project are:

1. Help children to gain basic knowledge through an interactive computer application. 
  *Children will be able to learn and know the basic knowledge through this application.

2. Help children to learn basic knowledge on their own.
  -Rather than learning with other people such as parent or teacher, children would be able to learn and know some of the basic knowledge without any guidance from anyone. This system will be able to provide the correct answer for children.
3. To attract children interest in learning.
  -By using interesting pictures, sound and easy way of learning, this will attract children interest to learn in an exciting and creative way. 
4. To assess children basic knowledge
  -Children will be given marks based on each of the question that they answered in this application. By knowing their mark, parent or children himself may assess their basic knowledge based on the marks that they get.</p>

**Scope of the Project**
<p>Before using this application, users need to sign up an account to be able to log in into this system.  The sign up requires username, password and email. Once the users have registered, a user profile will created. Next, they can log in using their own username and password. Successful log in will lead them to the homepage where they will be given the choice to enter the matching menu or the numbers menu.
Once user clicks on the matching menu, there will be three categories to choose from, Animals, Colours, and Fruits. After selecting, based on a category, the user will view objects and names, and they will match every object to its name using click and drag. There will a total of 10 questions in each categories. User may be able to click on the words of the objects name and hints will be given in audio form.  Every correct answer will carry 10 mark and no marks will be given for each question they answer wrongly. After users answer all the questions, the accumulate marks will appear and save into the database. When the user log in again or play again the application, the system will show the highest mark that the users has obtained previously and compare with the current mark that the users get after answering all the questions. 
In the numbers menu, there will be the following options; counting objects, addition/subtraction, and multiplication/division. When user chose one of the following, there will be 10 questions in each options. User are expected to solve the mathematical operation and type the answer in the answer box provided. Every correct answer will carry 10 mark and no marks will be given for each question they answer wrongly. After users answer all the questions, the accumulate marks will appear and save into the database. When the user log in again or play again the application, the system will show the highest mark that the users has obtained previously and compare with the current mark that the users get after answering all the questions. 
User may log out by click on log out button after they have finish using the system to prevent anyone from using their profile account on application for this system.
This project were created using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL Database.</p>

**Conclusion**
<p>This system were built intended to help children to gain some basic knowledge using interactive
computer application. By using an attractive graphical user interface and multimedia components such as sounds, images and text together with the clarity of the text, size, colours and material are going to attract and help children to learn the basic knowledge in more exciting and interesting way.</p>
